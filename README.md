# Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)

## About

This is a JavaScript project from **The Odin Project** curriculum — implementing a fully functional **Balanced Binary Search Tree (BST)**.  
It includes features like insertion, deletion, traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order), height & depth calculation, balance checking, and tree rebalancing.

Alhamdulillah

## What was needed to complete it:

- Building **Node** and **Tree** classes
- Writing a recursive `buildTree()` that creates a balanced BST
- Implementing `insert()`, `deleteItem()`, and `find()` methods
- Creating traversal methods: `inOrderForEach()`, `preOrderForEach()`, `postOrderForEach()`, and `levelOrderForEach()`
- Writing `height()` and `depth()` calculations
- Implementing `isBalanced()` and `rebalance()` functions
- Visualizing the tree structure with `prettyPrint()`

## Challenges that I’ve overcome:

- Managing **recursive logic** for tree building and traversals
- Handling **node deletion** cases (leaf, single child, two children) correctly
- Writing **balance checks** that evaluate every subtree
- Understanding the relationship between **height**, **depth**, and **balance**

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js (for testing)
